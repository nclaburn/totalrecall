Total Recall
===========

Total Recall is an extension of the [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) tutorial by [Dan Harper](http://danharper.me/), named [Recall](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/singing-with-sinatra-the-recall-app-2/). It was developed as an exercise to learn how to use [OmniAuth](http://www.omniauth.org/) for Twitter authentication in a Sinatra application.


The original[Recall](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/singing-with-sinatra-the-recall-app-2/) tutorial can be found on [Nettuts+](http://nettutsplus.com).

 Some code was <strike>lifted</strike> taken directly from a post on [Codebiff](http://codebiff.com) named [OmniAuth with Sinatra](http://codebiff.com/omniauth-with-sinatra/).


As this was developed as an exercise there are probably some errors.
